## CODE-CHALLENGE
This repository contains solutions to three programming challenges written in JavaScript. 
## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

E: 0 - 39
## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This program takes the speed of a car as input. It evaluates the speed against a set limit (70 km/h) and calculates demerit points based on the following rules:
-If speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok".
-For every 5 km/h above the limit, it assigns one demerit point.
-If the points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended".
## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

-Calculates gross salary.
-Deductions for PAYE (Tax), NHIF, and NSSF.
